DeepTrader: Reinforcement Learning for Forex Trading
This code implements a sophisticated reinforcement learning system for forex trading, particularly focused on the GBPAUD currency pair. Here's an overview of what the system does:
Key Components

Custom Environment (DeepTraderEnv)

Simulates a forex trading environment
Handles data preprocessing, including technical indicators
Manages trade execution and reward calculation


Neural Network Architecture

Uses a custom CNN-based feature extractor
Implements a custom actor-critic policy network


PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) Algorithm

Utilizes the Stable Baselines3 implementation of PPO
Customized for forex trading with specific hyperparameters


Data Handling and Preprocessing

Fetches historical forex data using yfinance
Calculates various technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.)


Training Pipeline

Implements a complete training loop with evaluation callbacks
Uses TensorBoard for logging and visualization


Backtesting and Analysis

Includes functions for backtesting the trained model
Provides analysis of backtest results (win rate, total return, etc.)
Visualizes backtest results using Plotly



Workflow

Data is fetched and preprocessed
The trading environment is created
The model is trained using PPO
The trained model is evaluated and saved
A backtest is performed on historical data
Results are analyzed and visualized

Key Features

Continuous action space for flexible trade decisions
Integration of multiple technical indicators
Custom reward function based on risk-reward ratio
Visualization of individual trades and overall performance
